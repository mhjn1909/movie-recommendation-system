# 🎬 Intelligent Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building an intelligent movie recommendation system that suggests personalized movies to users using recommendation techniques such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid approaches on the MovieLens dataset.

The goal is to understand how modern platforms like Netflix and Amazon recommend content and implement similar logic using machine learning concepts.

## 🧠 Abstract

Users are often unable to efficiently find suitable movies due to massive catalogs of films across various platforms and limitations of traditional recommendation systems. Existing models provide generic suggestions. Various research has explored collaborative filtering, content based filtering and hybrid recommendation approaches to address these challenges. An intelligent movie recommendation system, inspired by these research works, aims to recommend accurate and personalized movies to users.
